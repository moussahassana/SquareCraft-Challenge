## SquareCraft-Challenge

**SquareCraft-Challenge** is a strategic two-player game where the objective is to score points by forming perfect squares on a grid. Each player competes by placing their points on grid intersections, aiming to create four-point squares while blocking their opponent from doing the same.

### Objective
The goal is to score points by forming squares of four aligned points on the grid. Each square formed scores 1 point.

### Rules of the Game
1. **Setup:**
   - The game is played on an empty grid.
   - Two players participate, each using a different color (e.g., red and blue).

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns placing one point at a time on any intersection of the grid.
   - Points must be placed at intersections, not on the lines.

3. **Scoring:**
   - A player scores 1 point when they form a perfect square with four of their own points.
   - A perfect square is formed by placing points at the corners of a square on the grid, such as at coordinates (x, y), (x+1, y), (x, y+1), and (x+1, y+1).
   - When a square is formed, it should be marked visibly (e.g., by drawing a square around the points) and the score should be recorded.

4. **End of Game:**
   - The game ends when all intersections on the grid are occupied or when a predetermined number of turns is reached.
   - The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

### Example
